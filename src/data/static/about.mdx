My name is **Minato Hayashi**, and I was born in Japan but raised abroad due to my parents' work.
Growing up in different countries allowed me to experience various cultures, and it also instilled in me a deep curiosity about technology.

When I decided to attend university, I knew that I wanted to study computer science.
I enrolled in a university abroad, where I spent four years studying computer science and programming languages like **Java** and **C++**.
My time there gave me valuable knowledge that has been instrumental in my career.

After then, I landed a job as a member of an **online slot game** development team on abroad with help of my colleague.
It was a challenging but rewarding opportunity, as I had the chance to work in the online game industry.
My role on the team was primarily focused on developing APIs that could integrate slot game providers' games seamlessly into our platform.
We used **Node.js**, **MySQL**, and **Sequelize** to build these APIs.

In addition to API integration, I also built various **user and admin sites** for operating slot games on our platform.
These included balance management systems, user management systems, game management systems, fund calculation systems, and more.
My experience building complex backend architectures became one of my core strengths during my time with the team.

One of the most fascinating aspects of my job there, was learning about **online slot gaming theories**.
I learned about gambling **game API mode** (transfer and seamless), **balance calculation** of agents by class, **RTP concept** and so on.
These knowledges helped me understand the mechanics behind online gambling and how to create an optimal experience for users.

After three years with the slot team, I returned home and I explored other areas of web development and developed many projects.
I learned and studied other web development technologies and languages by myself.
Also, I realized that the structure of project is important for scalability and maintaining, and developed my own structured project for frontend and backend.

Over the years, I was lucky enough to work with several frontend and backend technologies.
My skill set includes front-end frameworks like **React.js**, **Next.js**, **Vue.js**, **Nuxt.js**, **Angular**, and **jQuery**, and back-end technologies such as **Express.js**, **Koa.js**, **Node.js**, and **Laravel**.
I am proficient in several programming languages, including Java, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, and PHP.
My experience with various databases like **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **MSSQL**, **SQLite**, **Redis**, and **MongoDB** has also given me a deeper understanding of how data is stored and accessed.

In my free time, I enjoy reading about the **latest trends in web development** and writing some blogs and attending seminars and conferences on the subject.
I believe that **staying up-to-date** with emerging technologies is essential for success in this field.

Looking back on my journey, I'm amazed at how far I've come.
As someone who started out with a simple curiosity about technology, I'm now proud to be a skilled web developer with expertise in a wide range of disciplines.
I look forward to continuing to challenge myself and learn new skills as the industry continues to evolve.
