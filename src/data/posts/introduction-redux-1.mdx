## 1-1. Introduction to Redux

Redux is the most used state management library. With Redux, you can separate the state-related logic of your components into different files
and manage them more efficiently. Also, when components share state, the state value can be easily passed without going through multiple
components.

In addition, Redux\'s middleware makes scalable tasks such as asynchronous operations and logging easier. More on this middleware
later!

### Determining the need

Redux is very effective when it comes to global state management. Of course, using Redux isn\'t the only solution. As a reminder, the same
can be done through the Context API.

First, let\'s look at the component structure of the ToDo List app.

In the todo list, when we add a value to a todo item in CreateForm, the handleCreate function passed to CreateForm from App is called, and when
this function is called, the todos value in the App\'s state is updated.

When the value of todos is updated, the corresponding value is passed to the TodoList so that all the Todo items we created will appear properly.

Looking at the structure above, the parent component called App acted as a middleman to exchange data between CreateForm and TodoList.

As above, a project with a simple structure does not need to use a separate state management library for global state management.

But, what if the component structure was just a little bit more complex?

The Root component has a state value called something, and a function called onDoSomething changes the value of something.

onDoSomething is passed to Root -\> B -\> H , and when an event occurs in H and this function is called, something is passed to Root -\> A -\>
E -\> F .

In order for the props to be properly delivered to the required place, having to go through a component that does not actually use the props is
inefficient and very cumbersome when re-rendering. If you change the props name in the parent component, you have to change it all the way
down it.

If you have Redux, you can work with the following structure.

**the store** that contains the state change logic , we can directly inject the desired state value and function into the desired component.

In this way, Redux is used for easier global state management, or for more systematic and convenient state management, but in the latter case,
you will have to actually use it to experience it. So, shall we move on?

## 1-2. Pre-arranging concepts

Let\'s take a look at the keywords that you will encounter in the future. This is only a brief overview of the concept, so if you don\'t
understand something along the way, you will understand it better if you come back to this section and read it again after using it yourself
later.

### Action

When the state needs to change something, we fire something called an action. This is represented as a single object, and the action object
has the following format.

```json
{
    "type": "TOGGLE_VALUE"
}
```

Action objects must have `a type `field, and other values can be entered as desired by the developer.

`example`

```json
{
    "type": "ADD_TODO",
    "data": {
        "id": 0,
        "text": "Learn Redux"
    }
}
```

```json
{
    "type": "CHANGE_INPUT",
    "text": "no"
}
```

### Action Creator

An action creator function is a function that creates an action. It simply takes parameters and turns them into an action object.

```javascript
function addTodo(data) {
    return {
        type: 'ADD_TODO',
        data,
    };
}

// Can also be made into an arrow function.
const changeInput = (text) => ({
    type: 'CHANGE_INPUT',
    text,
});
```

### Reducer

A reducer is a function that causes a change. The reducer takes two
parameters.

```javascript
function reducer(state, action) {
    // state update logic
    return alteredState;
}
```

The reducer creates and returns a new state based on the current state
and the received action. We will find out more about it later when
implementing it.

### Store

In Redux, you create one store per application. Inside the store, we
have the current app state, our reducers, plus a few built-in functions.

### Dispatch

Dispatch is one of the store\'s built-in functions. You can understand
dispatch as triggering an action. The action is passed as a parameter to
the function called dispatch. Like dispatch(action).

When you call it like that, the store executes the reducer function and
creates a new state by referring to the action if there is logic that
handles that action.

### Subscribe

Subscriptions are also one of the store\'s built-in functions. The
subscribe function receives a function-type value as a parameter. If you
pass a specific function to the subscribe function, the function you
passed in will be called whenever an action is dispatched.
